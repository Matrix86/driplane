## Slack

This feeder creates a stream using the [Slack Events API](https://api.slack.com/events-api). 
In order to use this feeder, you need to [create a Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps), define its Bot Token scopes and finally enable the Event Subscriptions.
The feeder will start a webserver to receive the events, so it should be reachable by slack. If you are behind a NAT or Firewall, you can enable [localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/).
Based on [slack-go/slack](https://github.com/slack-go/slack)
