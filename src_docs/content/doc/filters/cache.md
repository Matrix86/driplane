## Cache

This filter introduces a simple cache mechanism in the rule. It is a TTL based cache and it can have a local visibility (cache is only visible to the current filter) or a global visibility (cache shared across **ALL** the rules).
If the target of the Message as input has been cached before, and his TTL is not expired, it will be dropped and not propagated to the next filter. 
Otherwise if the target of the Message is new to the cache, it is inserted in it and propagated to the next filter.
