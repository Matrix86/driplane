In the rule could be defined 3 type of nodes:
FEEDER : it is the node responsible for creating of a stream of data (it reads every changes on a file, gets tweets from Twitter, etc..)
FILTER : it receives data from a feeder or another filter and checks some conditions on them or makes some changes on them.</description></item><item><title>Syntax</title><link>https://matrix86.github.io/driplane/doc/rules/syntax/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 22:38:02 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://matrix86.github.io/driplane/doc/rules/syntax/</guid><description>Syntax The syntax of the driplane&amp;rsquo;s rules is very simple. As for the BASH every filter&amp;rsquo;s output is sent to the next filter&amp;rsquo;s input concatenating the two of them with the | character.
All the rules have to start with a name and end with a ; char.
Rule Name and Rule Call Each rule has to start with an identifier follow by =&amp;gt;. This identifier identifies rule name and it could be used in another rule to concatenate 2 rules together.</description></item></channel></rss>
